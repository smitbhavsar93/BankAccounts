# BankAccounts
This was one of my first projects for my first Java course at Ryerson. 

A classic application of object-oriented techniques is a bank account.  In this lab, you will implement a simplified model of a bank account and of a bank itself.

A bank Account will track the account number, the owner's name and the current balance. The only operations allowed (apart from trivial getters) will be withdrawing and depositing money.  A user will not be allowed to make a deposit or withdrawal of a negative or zero value.  Furthermore, they will not be allowed to withdraw more money than they have in the account.

An account, of course, must belong a specific bank; hence you will also implement the Bankclass. A Bankobject will keep track of all of the accounts it has; it will also disallow two accounts with the same account numbe

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop the .java file into any java programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called NetBeans 8.2.
And that's it! No really. That's it. Now all you gotta do is run the "MainAccount.java" to get the Accounts of the individuals OR run the "MainBank.java" to get the Bank Accounts for each specific individual.

## NetBeans 8.2
This program was coded on Eclipse, to download NetBeans 8.2, visit : https://netbeans.org/downloads/old/8.2/ and download their latest release on your compatible device.
